			        <p class="blocktext"> Sara Warfield is a retired postal employee, mentor, singer, and stage actress. She is a native of Monessen, Pennsylvania, and currently resides in Oklahoma City. Young Sara's unique training at Philadephia's prestigious, 
             Conservatory of Arts & Music and her study of Piano at Settlement School of Philadelphia prepared her for a professional career as an opera singer. She decided instead to marry, raise a family, and pursue other interests. <br><br>Her efforts were  
             rewarded by many subsequent concert and theater performances, and at 86, she is mother to eighty-two grandchildren. Sara was honored when she was approached by a theatre company in Topeka, Kansas, about starring in her <br>own show. 
             Her one and half hour performance in "An Evening With Sara" was a local hit and featured in the newspaper. <br><br> Events changed in her life after she lost a son who was walking on his way to school. She also lost her husband and had to raise  
             eight children on her own. Sara fought back. She gives the heavenly father all the credit for having come through her ordeals with a stronger faith and love for him. Today her mission and values center around providing mentorship, 
             serving <br>as a community role model, and spreading her wisdom to family and friends in the US and many other countries. <br><br> Sara is a gifted communicator with a passion for people, particularly young women who she mentors and councils in their
             marriage and personal relationships. Sara has a deep love for her creator and believes in simple, moral, traditional values. <br>An explorer who loves to travel and meet new people, "Memaw," they call her, still delivers hats and gloves to her friends <br>and relatives that she crochets by hand. Sara is an advent Gardner and continues to sing.
