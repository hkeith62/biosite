			        <p class="blocktext">Sara Warfield is a retired postal employee, mentor, singer, and stage actress. She is a native of Monessen, Pennsylvania and currently resides in Oklahoma City.Young Sara's unique training at Philadephia's prestigious, 
            Conservatory of Arts & Music and her study of Piano at Settlement School of Philadelphia prepared her for a professional career as an opera singer. She decided instead to raise a family and pursue other interests. <br><br>Those efforts were 
            rewarded by many subsequent concert and theater performances, and at 86, she is mother to 82 grandchildren. Sara was given a high honor when she was approached by a top theatre company in Topeka Kansas to be the star of her own show. 
            Her one and half hour performance in "An Evening With Sara" was a local hit and featured in <br>the newspaper. <br><br>Events changed in her life after she lost a son who was walking on his way to school. She also lost her husband and had to raise 
            eight children on her own. Sara fought back. She gives the heavenly father all the credit for her having come through her ordeals with a stronger faith and love for him. Today her mission and values center around providing mentorship, 
            serving as a community role model, and spreading her wisdom to family and friends in the US and across the globe. <br><br>Sara is a gifted communicator with a passion for people, particularly young women who she mentors and councils in their 
            marriage, personal relationships, and on improving self-worth. She is currently engaged in her work with young Jewish women living abroad in Israel, to which she travels regularly. Sara has a deep love for her creator and believes in 
            simple, moral, traditional values. An explorer who loves to travel and meet new people, "Memaw," as she is called, still delivers hats and gloves to her friends and relatives that she crochetes by hand. Sara is an advent Gardner and 
            continues to sing.</p>
