			    <p class="blocktext"> Sara Warfield is a retired postal employee, mentor, singer, and stage actress. She is a native of Monessen, Pennsylvania and now resides in Oklahoma City. Young Sara's unique training at Philadephia's prestigious 
            Conservatory of Arts & Music and her study of Piano at Settlement School of Philadelphia prepared her for a career as an opera singer. She decided instead to marry, raise a family, and pursue other interests.</p> 
            <p class="blocktext"> Sara continued to sing and perform on-stage. She was honored when approached by a professional <br>theatre company to star in her own show. Her performance in "An Evening with Sara" was a local hit. Events changed in her life after she lost a son on his way to school. She also lost her husband and had<br>to raise  
            eight children on her own. Sara fought back. Today her mission and values center around providing mentorship, serving as a community role model, and spreading her wisdom to family and friends. At 86, she is mother to eighty-two grandchildren.</p><p class="blocktext"> Sara is a gifted communicator with a passion for people, particularly young women who she mentors and councils in their
            marriage and personal relationships. Sara believes in simple, moral, traditional values. She loves to travel and meet new people, and "Memaw," they call her, still delivers hats and gloves to loved ones that she crochets by hand.
